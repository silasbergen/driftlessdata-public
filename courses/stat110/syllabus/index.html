<p><strong><em>Required software</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JMP -</strong> available from WSU network for free. <a href="https://silasbergen.github.io/JMP_installation.html">Download instructions</a></li>
<li><strong>Tinkerplots</strong> - costs $7. <a href="https://silasbergen.github.io/Tinkerplots.pdf">Download instructions</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Optional text</em></strong></p>

<p>There is no text required for this course. However, if you would like to
refer to a textbook, a good reference is <em>Unlocking the Power of Data</em>
by Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock, and Lock.</p>

<p><strong><em>Prerequisites</em></strong></p>

<p>Qualifying score on the mathematics placement exam or MATH 050.</p>

<p><strong><em>Basic Skills Learning Outcomes</em></strong></p>

<p>This course can be used to satisfy the University Studies Program&rsquo;s
requirements for Basic Skills in Mathematics or Goal Area 4 under the
new General Education Program. This includes requirements and learning
activities that will promote your abilities to.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Illustrate historical and contemporary applications of
mathematical/logical systems;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clearly express mathematical/logical ideas in writing;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explain what constitutes a valid mathematical/logical argument
(proof); and</strong></li>
<li><strong>Apply higher-order problem-solving and/or modeling strategies.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Additional learning outcomes</em></strong></p>

<p>The successful Stat 110 student will be able to.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>use logical reasoning by studying mathematical patterns and
relationships</strong> One of the major goals of statistics is to find patterns and
relationships in datasets. Hence almost all lectures, homework
problems, and test questions in the course have the study of
patterns for variables and relationships between variables as their
basis.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>use mathematical models to describe real-world phenomena and to
solve real-world problems - as well as understand the limitations of
models in making predictions and drawing conclusions</strong>
In all of the textbooks and course notes used in STAT 110 the
majority of the problems are real-world based and are &ldquo;word&rdquo;
problems. Further, all instructors require the students when doing
such problems to write conclusions and discuss limitations.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>organize data, communicate the essential features of the data, and
interpret the data in a meaningful way</strong>
This is the heart of STAT 110. The topics covered are chosen so
that students who complete the course can organize data, communicate
essential features of the data both numerically and graphically and
provide interpretations/conclusions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>do a critical analysis of scientific and other research</strong>
The scientific method is discussed early in the course. The logic
of hypothesis testing is discussed in detail. Further, on tests and
written assignments the students are expected to go beyond a simple
analysis and provide implications, interpretations, and conclusions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>extract correct information from tables and common graphical
displays, such as line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and
frequency tables</strong>
All of these topics are explicitly taught in STAT 110 and are on
the course outline. Please note that &ldquo;line graphs&rdquo; is subsumed under
&ldquo;Frequency distributions and histograms&rdquo;. Also, please note that
&ldquo;scatter plots&rdquo; are more formally called &ldquo;Bivariate displays&rdquo; by
statisticians.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>express the relationships illustrated in graphical displays and
tables clearly and correctly in words</strong>
As can be seen from the course outline, graphical displays and
tables cover a significant portion of the course content. As
discussed above, interpretation in words is expected by all
instructors on homework and tests.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>use appropriate technology to describe and solve quantitative
problems.</strong>
As stated on the course outline, &ldquo;It is required that at least one
assignment using an appropriate computer package be included in the
course.&rdquo; In this section of STAT 110, we will primarily use a
statistical software package called JMP.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Assessment tasks</em></strong></p>

<p>The following assessments will be used to gauge growth in the Basic
Skills and additional learning outcomes.</p>

<p><em>Quizzes (10%)</em></p>

<p>The section of Stat 110 you are taking is <em>flipped</em>.  This means that the PowerPoint lectures are all recorded on video that you watch on your own outside of class, and class time is spent on additional problem solving, concept review, and completing homework.  The video lectures have practice quiz questions embedded along the way, just to help keep the video interactive and help you assess your understanding along the way.  There will also be practice D2L practice quizzes that you can take an unlimited number of times.  The video quiz and D2L practice quizzes are just for practice; you are not graded on these.  After watching the videos and taking the practice quizzes, we will have <em>in-class quizzes</em> that you can take <strong>up to two times</strong>.  Your score on the quiz will be the highest of the attempts.  Your cumulative score on these quizzes will account for 10% of your final grade.  Your single lowest quiz score will be dropped.</p>

<p><em>Attendance (5%)</em></p>

<p>Attending class is very important. Lots of learning happens in class, including group discussions; problem solving; and review of important concepts.  Accordingly, 5% of your final grade is based on our simple attendance, which I will take at some point during each class period.</p>

<p><em>Group homework assignments (35%)</em></p>

<p>Roughly half of the in-class time will be spent doing group
homework assignments. There are a number of benefits to in-class group
assignments:</p>

<ul>
<li>No (or at least, very little) homework outside of class!<br /></li>
<li>You get to explain concepts to, and hear explanations from, your
classmates. It&rsquo;s very likely that I will explain a concept in a way
you did not understand, but a classmate will explain it to you in a
way that you can understand.</li>
<li>Those of you who <em>do</em> understand a concept will understand it <em>ever
better</em> when you try to explain it to a classmate!</li>
<li>I am there in class with you, so as to better answer your questions
as they arise.
But don&rsquo;t take my word for it!  Here&rsquo;s a word cloud of responses to the question &ldquo;What did you like BEST about in-class group homework&rdquo; I asked on the previous two semeters&rsquo; course evaluations:</li>
</ul>

<p><center>
<figure>
 <img src="../../../img/group-best-wordcloud.png" width="500">
</figure>
</center>
I will alternate between randomly assigning you into groups (usually of 3), and
allowing you to select your own groups.  Students will submit their assignments to
 D2L, and all students in a group will get the same homework grade. The
 homework practice concepts learned in class. Homework assignment will
 often require use of JMP or Tinkerplots. <strong>Homework that is submitted
 after I have uploaded a key will receive a 0.</strong></p>

<p><em>Two midterm exams (30%)</em></p>

<p>These exams will require you to demonstrate your <em>understanding</em> of the
material as opposed to your ability to <em>memorize</em> certain concepts. The
format will primarily be a combination of short answer, multiple choice,
and T/F. Exam dates will be announced at least one week in advance.
Rescheduling of an exam will be permitted only if there is a
family/medical emergency. Also, <strong>you must contact me before the exam is
to be taken</strong>. Arrangements will be made for the exam to be taken at an
earlier time, if at all possible.</p>

<p><em>Final exam (20%)</em></p>

<p>This exam will include material covered since the second midterm exam as
well as material learned over the course of the entire semester.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final grades</em></strong></p>

<p>Final grades will be a percent that accounts for work on homework and
exams. Final grades will be assigned as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>90-100%: A</li>
<li>80-89%: Guaranteed at least a B</li>
<li>70-79%: Guaranteed at least a C</li>
<li>60-69%: Guaranteed at least a D</li>
<li>&lt;60%: No lower than F</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Laptops</em></strong></p>

<p>I encourage you to bring your laptop to class every day so that our
classroom can function as a computer lab. I expect you to use your laptop in class for <strong>ACADEMIC
PURPOSES ONLY</strong>!  Also having a FULL BATTERY (or nearly full) is really beneficial!</p>

<p><strong><em>Academic integrity policy</em></strong></p>

<p>All students must abide by Winona State University&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.winona.edu/sld/academicintegrity.asp">Academic Integrity
Policy</a>. Note that both copying
another student&rsquo;s work and allowing someone to copy your work are clear violations of this
policy. If there is reasonable evidence of copying another individual&rsquo;s work, it will be construed as
an act of plagiarism. The first occurrence of violating the academic integrity policy will result
in a significant loss of points on that specific homework assignment or exam; the second occurrence will
result in failure of the course.</p>

<p><strong><em>Expectations</em></strong></p>

<p>In this course, I expect each of you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to genuinely try your hardest and to demand the best of yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>to seek help if you are confused or if you are starting to fall
behind. Please make use of my office hours or the tutoring available
via WSU Tutoring Services.</p></li>

<li><p>to be an active learner. This involves ATTENDING and PARTICIPATING
in class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In return, you can expect the following from me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a sincere desire for you to learn and an effort to support you in
your learning.</p></li>

<li><p>an honest attempt to be fair to everyone in the class.</p></li>

<li><p>an effort to make the learning atmosphere productive and enjoyable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>DETAILS ABOUT CAMPUS RESOURCES</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Commitment to inclusive excellence</em></strong></p>

<p>WSU recognizes that our individual differences can deepen our
understanding of one another and the world around us, rather than divide
us. In this class, people of all ethnicities, genders, religions, ages,
sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions,
and nationalities are strongly encouraged to share their rich array of
perspectives and experiences. If you feel your differences may in some
way isolate you from WSU&rsquo;s community or if you have a need of any
specific accommodations, please speak with the instructor early in the
semester about your concerns and what we can do together to help you
become an active and engaged member of our class and community.</p>
