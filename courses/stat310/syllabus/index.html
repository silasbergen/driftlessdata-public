<h3 id="stat-310-intermediate-statistics-stat310-home"><a href="../stat310-home/">STAT 310: Intermediate Statistics</a></h3>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>

<p>There is no required text for this class. A recommended text for student
reference is <em>Stat 2: Building Models for a World of Data</em> by Cannon et
al. This text is well-written and has some nice problems for additional
student practice. However, it can get technical at times. You will not
need this text to complete the homework or succeed on exams.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Stat 110, STAT 210, STAT 303, STAT 305, PSY231, or equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>

<p>We will make extensive use of JMP to perform most
statistical analyses in this course. Instructions for downloading JMP
onto your laptop are on the course webpage.</p>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>STAT 310 will reinforce topics from your first course in statistics,
including the logic of inference, and the proper scope of conclusions
drawn from research studies. We will also learn about the concept of a
statistical model. This course will promote your abilities to&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>identify research questions that may be answered using various
statistical models and to translate these questions into the
appropriate analysis procedure. A successful student will be a
knowledgeable consumer of the statistical methods presented, and be
able to properly obtain and use these methods.</p></li>

<li><p>model and solve real-world problems, as well as understand
limitations of models making predictions and drawing conclusions.
Almost all the problems we will encounter are real-world examples. A
successful student will be able to answer research questions with
statistical models and to approach such problems with confidence.</p></li>

<li><p>recognize underlying model assumptions and employ methods for
checking these assumptions.</p></li>

<li><p>analyze data and summarize the results in a meaningful way. You
should have acquired some of these skills in your introductory
statistics course, but in this class you will focus even more on
effectively communicating results.</p></li>

<li><p>use appropriate technology to carry out analyses.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assessment-tasks">Assessment tasks</h3>

<p>The following assessments will be used to gauge growth in the above
learning outcomes.</p>

<p><em>Participation (0%)</em></p>

<p>Although you will not be graded on participation, attending class is
essential to succeed in this course. Class time will often be spent completing
group activities that mimic homework assignments.  If you are not in class, you are missing out these valuable
learning experiences that will help you do well on your homework and on exams.</p>

<p><em>Homework (35%)</em></p>

<p>Homework will be assigned regularly throughout the semester. These
assignments will almost always involve the use of JMP to analyze real
data and will require you to communicate your results in clearly written
interpretations and conclusions. You are encouraged to work together on
your homework, but <strong>each student must turn in their own original
copy with answers in their own words</strong>.
<strong>Late homework will be penalized, and any homework submitted after the key is posted will receive a 0.</strong>
Aim to get your homework done 24 hours before it is due to
minimize the chance of unforeseen circumstances delaying its completion.</p>

<p><em>Two midterm exams (20% each)</em></p>

<p>Midterm exam dates will be announced at least one week in advance. The
exams will require you to apply what you learn from homework and lecture
to accurately interpret data summaries and statistical output. Make-up
exams will only be given in cases of extreme personal or family
emergency. I must be notified in advance of the exam date if you wish to
schedule a make-up exam; failure to comply may result in a grade of 0 on
that exam.</p>

<p><em>Final exam (25%)</em></p>

<p>Final exam dates are set by the university. This exam will require you to apply what you learn from
homework and lecture to accurately interpret data summaries and
statistical output. Make-up exams will only be given in cases of extreme
personal or family emergency. I must be notified in advance of the exam
date if you wish to schedule a make-up exam; failure to comply may
result in a grade of 0 on that exam.</p>

<h3 id="writing-intensive">Writing intensive</h3>

<p>Stat 310 satisfies the GEP Writing Intensive.  To qualify as a writing intensive, students must:</p>

<ul>
<li>practice the processes and procedures for creating and completing successful writing in their fields;</li>
<li>understand the main features and uses of writing in their fields;</li>
<li>adapt their writing to the general expectations of readers in their field;</li>
<li>make use of technologies commonly used for research and writing in their fields;</li>
<li>learn the conventions of evidence, format, usage, and documentation in their fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>A substantial portion of each exam will be take-home,  and you will be graded according to a writing rubric on each of these take-home portions.</p>

<h3 id="final-grade">Final Grade</h3>

<p>Final grades will be assigned as follows:</p>

<p>90-100%: A<br />
80-89%: Guaranteed at least a B<br />
70-79%: Guaranteed at least a C<br />
60-69%: Guaranteed at least a D</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic integrity policy</h3>

<p>All students must abide by Winona State University&rsquo;s Academic Integrity
Policy: <a href="http://www.winona.edu/sld/academicintegrity.asp">http://www.winona.edu/sld/academicintegrity.asp</a>. Note that both
copying another student&rsquo;s work and allowing someone to copy your work
are clear violations of this policy. If there is reasonable evidence of
copying another individual&rsquo;s work, it will be construed as an act of
plagiarism. The first occurrence of violating the academic integrity
policy will result in a significant loss of points on that specific
homework assignment or exam; the second occurrence will result in
failure of the course.</p>

<h3 id="commitment-to-inclusive-excellence">Commitment to Inclusive Excellence</h3>

<p>WSU recognizes that our individual differences can deepen our
understanding of one another and the world around us, rather than divide
us. In this class, people of all ethnicities, genders and gender
identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities,
socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly
encouraged to share their rich array of perspectives and experiences.
If you feel your differences may in some way isolate you from WSU&rsquo;s
community or if you have a need of any specific accommodations, please
speak with me early in the semester about your concerns and what we can
do together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class
and community.</p>

<h3 id="details-about-campus-resources">DETAILS ABOUT CAMPUS RESOURCES</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Two good places to help you find resources of all kinds on campus
are <em>Student Support/Campus Services</em> and the <em>Inclusion and
Diversity Office</em>. Both offices are dedicated to helping students of
all races, ethnicities, economic backgrounds, nationalities, and
sexual orientations. They can facilitate tutoring and point you to a
wide range of resources.</p></li>

<li><p>If you have a disability, the <em>Access Services</em> office can document
it for your professors and facilitate accommodations. If you have a
documented disability that requires accommodation, please contact
Access Services as soon as possible.</p></li>

<li><p>College can be very stressful. <em>Counseling</em> offices on both campuses
are here to help you with a wide range of difficulties, ranging from
sexual assault, depression, and grief after the loss of a loved one
to stress management, anxiety, general adjustment to college, and
many others.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>GLBTA Advocate</em> can direct people to GLBT resources on and off
campus. In addition, the advocate is responsible for documenting
homophobic and transphobic incidents on campus and working with the
appropriate channels to get these incidents resolved.</p></li>

<li><p>To find out about web registration, placement tests, program
requirements and support tools to help students succeed, visit the
<em>Advising Services</em> office and website for answers to all your
questions!</p></li>

<li><p>On the Rochester campus, the <em>UCR Learning Center</em> provides help
with both the development and the writing of papers</p></li>

<li><p>Free tutoring is available via tutoring services. You can schedule
appointments with tutors during times that fit with your schedule.
See <a href="http://www.winona.edu/tutoring/">http://www.winona.edu/tutoring/</a> for more.</p></li>
