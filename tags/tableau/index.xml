      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s MakeoverMonday is a good one. Without further ado, the original visualization by Philip Bump, appearing in his Washington Post article entitled Nearly a quarter of Americans have never experienced the U.S. in a time of peace:
  This graph triggered my pedagogical Pavlovian dog. Not just because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to malign the poor pie chart (of which this graph has 115!), but because I had a hunch that a redesign would reveal features of the data that are obscured above.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted! For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in joining the MakeoverMonday community, a group of data visualizers who come together each week to critique and redesign a visualization provided by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel. I haven&amp;rsquo;t, due to busyness mostly, but this semester I finally took the dive and signed up! Call it a 2020 resolution. I hope that this will become a regular opportunity for me to keep developing my visualization critique and design skills.</description>

      <title>Quantifying thrill</title>

      <description>Monday morning, October 30, found me groggy and sandy-eyed. The culprit was the 5-hour and 17-minute, 10-inning thriller between the LA Dodgers and Houston Astros in Game 5 of the 2017 the night before. Thanks to living in the Central Time Zone, I went to bed around 1am. The Astros ended up defeating the Dodgers 13-12, but the game was insane, featuring three comebacks from deficits of 3 runs or more.</description>

      <title>Racial disparity in Winona Area Public School District</title>
      <link>http://driftlessdata.space/post/viz-waps-disparity/</link>

      <description>This visualization project was inspired by the excellent This American Life episode,  Is This Working?   The entire episode is well worth a listen, but the gist of the episode was that racial inequity in disciplinary action translates into racial inequity in academic outcomes. I was curious to see if this association held up, in the Winona Area Public Schools, using publicly available data from the Minnesota Department of Education Data Center.</description>

      <description>As I was watching Chris Rock host the 2016 Oscars, I decided to finally scratch my curiosity itch and learn R&amp;rsquo;s Twitter API, twitteR. The 2016 Oscars were controversial, due to the fact that all the actors and actresses nominated were white for the second year in a row. Chris Rock made sure to point this out in his opening monologue, and tweets began using the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite to advance the conversation.</description>
